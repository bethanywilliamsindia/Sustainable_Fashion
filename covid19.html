        <h4 style="margin-left: 6.5em;" class="parawidt mt-3">For our Employees </h4>
        <p class="parawidth">Bethany Williams is happy to announce that the company has decided to cover vaccination costs across the group. At Bethany Williams, we prioritize the health and well-being of not only our employees and their loved ones but also our extended family who work directly with us including advisors and consultants. While this vaccine is voluntary, it is also one of the most effective tools to fight against COVID-19. As the Government gears up for the next phase of the vaccination drive, we encourage all our employees and their families to opt for the vaccine and fight against COVID-19. <br><br>
          The vaccination drive will also be extended to all the direct contractual employees, consultants, advisors of the company and their immediate dependants including spouse, kids and parents, comprising more than 5000+ people. The vaccination drive will be over and above Bethany Williams existing medical insurance policy.

The target of programme is to supports the livelihood of more than 7.5 lakh artisans, weavers and craftsmen across India.<br><br>
          Apart from this, we are also working for the vaccination of our local partners. This initiative will help India’s local artisans, weavers, craftsmen and smaller textile industry workers to get protection from virus.
          The company is partnering with relevant authorities to conduct the vaccination drive. The vaccination will be offered on a voluntary basis. Bethany Williams will provide requisite infrastructure and logistics for the vaccination with the drive being conducted across all the India.<br><br>

        <h4 style="margin-left: 6.5em;" class="parawidt mt-5">For Our Customers:</h4>
        <p class="parawidth">To undertake multiple precautionary measures to ensure safety and well-being of all our customers and employees. We are ensuring all adequate precautions in our stores. In addition to the installation of world-class technologies such as thermal sensing camera, AI-based face mask identification, smartphone-based entry and exit system, Bethany Williams has been actively conducting Smart Sample testing on a regular basis to curb potential spread of the virus. <br><br>
          We are supportive of government agencies who would like to leverage our solutions for vaccine management. We would be working with industry bodies to understand how we can help and support them.<br><br>
          We have put in the capabilities and we are starting to showcase it to various jurisdictions and as anyone sees that if it's of any value, we will be happy to help them. <br><br>
