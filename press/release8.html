        <p class="my-4 parawidth"><small>2nd April 2021</small></p>
        <p class="parawidth">On the heels of launching a Sustainable fashion design course in NIFT Delhi, Queen Elizabeth Awardee fashion designer, Bethany Williams was invited for an interactive session with the students of NIFT Delhi. </p>
        <p class="parawidth">She spoke about what and How skills can make a sustainable fashion designer and why there is need to think on the concept of Sustainability in fashion industry. Somesh Singh, joint director, NIFT and Vandana Bhandari, professor and coordinator, Knitwear Design, NIFT, were also present on the occasion with the designer.</p>
        <p class="parawidth">The session was attended by NIFT students, faculty and industry members. Students had interaction with the popular sustainable designer, where she shared the details of her success. she said, “Every designer needs hard work along with creativity and business acumen to become a successful designer. Sustainable success can be achieved through proper time management, HR management and leadership qualities.”</p>
        <p class="parawidth">The designer further advised students to identify their strengths and work on them, adding that work should be the ‘only religion’.</p>
        <p class="parawidth">According to Williams, Gandhiji’s khadi is an ingenuous creation. All organisations in India should keep one day as ethnic day at their workplace and people should only wear traditional garments to mark the importance of Indian fashion. she informed the students that the tools of fashion designers are far more powerful than any weapon in the world.</p>
        <p class="parawidth">On innovation about sustainability in the fashion industry, she said, “It is very important. India has had great innovators like Mahatma Gandhi, Subhash Chandra Bose and now India should look at creating design leaders who can innovate business of fashion by creating their own fashion ideas and language and should explore Indian culture and heritage rather than blindly following the West. On sustainable fashion and carbon footprints, she advised that craft and handwork, which is a big part of our culture and heritage, can help in creating an eco-friendly approach towards fashion.</p>
