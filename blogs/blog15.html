        <p class="parawidth">Bethany Williams believes Fashion demonstrates personal individuality and self-expression, and with all the current fashion trends, nowadays, people can express themselves in more ways than ever before with so many unique styles to choose from.  It has been quite an interesting observation when it comes to reviewing all the new fashion trends that have sprouted up over the past few years. <br><br>
            Many style devotees consider the 1960's to be the defining moment for men's style as it was this time span that previously presented a portion of the plan components that we see today. <br><br>
            
            A portion of the clothing delivered, harking back to the 1960's incorporated things like shirts with bloomed plans, pants that were "thin" and surprisingly enormous lapels. It was now, too, that men's suits turned into a piece smaller and tight-fitted and attire brands began to get inventive with their plans. <br><br>
            Not exclusively were the plans of the apparel changing however splendid shadings likewise began to get noticeable in men's garments plans. This bright attire pattern turned out to be broadly well known and embraced rapidly as open influencers, for example, the Beatles started to participate in this new style. <br><br>
            
            Some say that fashion from the ’70s came from another planet–and we’d be hard-pressed not to believe them. The ’70s were a crazy time. Styles that would’ve been laughed at just 10 years prior became big. As synthetic fabrics came about, materials dropped in price, and travel and shipping became easier, fast fashion was the name of the game. Casual menswear and the “wash and wear” evolution of men’s clothing became abundant and widely available at extremely low prices. This was a direct reflection of the era’s air of spontaneity and indulgence.<br><br>
            
            Since the economy was doing well, men’s fashion took a turn toward excess. Brand names and slouchier fits were all the rage. Young Working Professionals made preppy-casual a significant ’80s trend.<br><br>
            
            The 1990s experienced another huge fashion transformation as men basically banished all trends from the ’60s, ’70s, and ’80s in attempt to redefine themselves. “Casual” was undoubtedly here to stay, and minimalism was the new “in” thing. Mainstream fashions were influenced by three significant youth subcultures of the decade: rave, hip-hop, and grunge (a direct diss to the excess and flashiness of the past two decades). T-shirts, shorts, jeans, trainers, sweatshirts, hoodies, tattoos, piercings, and prominently displayed brands comprised the majority of any man’s closet. In fact, the shift towards a more casual work uniform began thanks to the ’90s and its rejection of stuffiness and formality.<br><br>
            At the turn of the millennium, men’s fashion experienced a brief “futuristic” wave. Black, silver, and metallic were in. Men wore leather outfits, puffy jackets, tracksuits, and Rockport boots. In the mid-2000s, styles sobered as the US entered war. Distressed denim became popular, along with military wear as everyday clothes. Popular colours included beige, rust, and forest green, and men wore low-rise jeans, light-coloured polos, cargo pants, khakis, and short sleeved button-downs. Accessories such as white belts, aviators, trucker hats, flip-flops, Argyle print, and oxford shoes were also in the early 2010s experienced a revival of ’20s prep style, along with an exponential rise in fast fashion and globalization. Smart casual looks, athleisure, along with hipster fashions were on trend.<br><br>
            The essence of these fashion trends has made its way to the sustainable designs of Bethany Williams to make sure that men’s apparels do not lack the trendiness while being environment friendly.<br><br>
