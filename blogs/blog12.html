        <p class="text-center parawidth">BETHANY WILLIAMS AS A FASHION BRAND HAS BEEN STRIVING TO PUT THEIR BEST FOOT FORWARD IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY AND WORKING TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY AND BETTERMENT OF OUR ENVIRONMENT. WE HAVE FLOURISHED AS A BRAND OVER YEARS AND WE HAVE REALISED
            SUSTAINABLE FASHION IS THE NEED OF THE HOUR
        </p>
        <h4 class="parawidth mt-5 h4leftmgn">1. IT IS A HAZARD TO OUR ENVIRONMENT </h4>
        <p class="parawidth">Globally, one garbage truck containing textile waste is dumped at a landfill or burnt every second. On the other hand, sustainable brands focus on clothing quality, using long-lasting materials in their clothing production. Sustainable fashion brands rarely follow fast fashion trends. They focus on classic and timeless pieces rather than pushing new collections weekly that force customers to buy more. Sustainable fashion items are also made from long-lasting materials, whether you are shopping for popular leggings or eco-friendly watches. The fast fashion industry leads to huge environmental damage. From the landfill impact, and power and water consumption, to the pesticides and insecticide used in growing cotton along with the chemicals that are being dumped in the water and affecting the health of those in the supply chain. The textile waste that is being dumped along with the harmful dyes making their way to the water bodies. It is safe to say fast fashion is one of the major problem for the environment. In choosing sustainable fashion you can say no to supporting the negative environmental impact that the fashion industry is causing, and in-turn reduce your own environmental foot print. </p>
        <h4 class="parawidth mt-5 h4leftmgn">2. FOR THE WORKING CLASS  </h4>
        <p class="parawidth"> Fast fashion is mainly responsible for these large amounts of waste, as these brands sacrifice clothing longevity for low prices and more purchases from clients. Fast fashion has kept the cost of clothing down at the cost of low pay and conditions in developing countries. By switching to ethically made brands you are ensuring that the clothing you choose to spend your money on hasn’t taken advantage of workers or used child labour. This low clothing cost is made possible by harsh working conditions for garment workers. Fast fashion brands set up factories in the southern countries where workers are paid far below a living wage. Poor safety and health conditions, long working hours, and the constant pressure to produce all create an environment of worker exploitation. Frequent child labour accusations have also been levelled against fast fashion brands. By switching to more ethical and sustainable brands, you can be more confident that your clothing was produced under safe and fair working conditions.  </p>
        <h4 class="parawidth mt-5 h4leftmgn">3. WHAT ABOUT YOUR OWN STYLE </h4>
        <p class="parawidth">Fast fashion is full of trends changing every week telling people what to wear resulting in people losing their own sense of style. As Ralph Lauren put it, "Style is very personal. It has nothing to do with fashion. Fashion is over quickly. Style is forever." Sustainable fashion brands are known for their classic, timeless, and high-quality pieces, unique 
            pieces, and today’s diverse range of choices gives wearers more opportunity to be creative, experiment, express themselves, and craft a distinct personal style. Many sustainable fashion consumers attest to finding enjoyment in clothes that truly reflect their styles. Sustainable fashion is an excellent way to build a new wardrobe of great, quality clothes that reflect you. 
            Customization done by brands help people to put in their own prospective to their cloths. 
        </p>
        <h4 class="parawidth mt-5 h4leftmgn">4. BECAUSE ITS UNIQUE AND HELFUL JUST LIKE YOU </h4>
        <p class="parawidth">Sustainable brands are shifting more and more back to local production. Sourcing local materials, employing local craftsmen, and refusing to sell the clothes globally have a major positive impact on the environment. And as a bonus, local production creates jobs and boosts the local economy. Small businesses getting a good response from the customers. Art forms like block printing, cloth painting etc are getting recognized and appreciated again. Thrift stores selling the most unique, one of its own kind high quality but low cost products which will up your fashion game are emerging. Instagram has become a huge community for thrifters. </p>
        <h4 class="parawidth mt-5 h4leftmgn">5. BECAUSE LET THE ANIMAL BE IN ITS SKIN </h4>
        <p class="parawidth">Animals are an essential aspect of our ecosystem, each playing a unique role to ensure that our planet is habitable. Any threat to wildlife and other animals' safety should be a concern to us all. Leather bags, boots, and items produced from fur, leather, feathers, and wool, often have harmful effects on animal populations from which the materials are sourced. Some endangered species like the Sumatran Tiger and American Alligator still suffer severe depletion from being hunted for clothing.   
            <br><br>
            You can save animals by choosing sustainable clothing brands. Many 
            ethical brands lead the way with cruelty-free clothing, and some fast fashion brands are also dropping fur from their collections in support. Human-made fibres, recycled materials, and bamboo are viable alternatives that these sustainable fashion brands rely on as an alternative to animal products. This way, several animals are spared harm, abuse, and death, preserving the ecosystem's balance.
