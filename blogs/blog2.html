        <p class="parawidth">“We can’t just consume our way to a more sustainable world.” <small>- By Jennifer Nini</small></p>
        <p class="parawidth">The shopping sack that you proudly carry while after ordering or coming out of a shopping mall is an incredible image, an inconspicuous showcase of your image decisions without being named garish. Packaging is utilized to ensure a wide range of items, going from teeny coverings to boxes of howdy fi frameworks. You can track down a wide scope of shapes and sizes, all intended for various purposes. Packaging is vital, as goods need to be transported to the consumer in a safe, hygienic and protected condition. Packaging can likewise give an impression to the customers about the brand, keep segment parts, promote different products and even make physiological fascination.</p>
        <h4 class="parawidth mt-5" style="margin-left: 6.7em;">TURNING “JUST PACKAGING INTO SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING”</h4>
        <p class="parawidth">Today, first impressions are important for any business, not only the fashion industry, and with the rise of online brand influencers and “unboxing” videos on YouTube and Instagram those first impressions can be easily shared with the wider world. By using eco-friendly, compostable or recycled packaging for your apparel you can both create a good impression and reduce waste. Using eco-friendly packaging demonstrates to your customers that you care deeply about the environment and are doing your part to reduce your carbon footprint. </p>
