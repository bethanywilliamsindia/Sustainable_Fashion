    <p class="parawidth">The way sustainable fashion is perceived is a direct response to the way it is marketed and talked about!</p>
    <p class="parawidth"><b>What is Sustainable Fashion? </b></p>
    <p class="parawidth">Before we dive in, we want to first clarify what sustainable fashion actually is. Practicing sustainability generally means avoiding depletion of natural resources. In fashion, the main target is overconsumption, though labour ethics and viewing your wardrobe from a long-term perspective also play a role. The way we see it, sustainable fashion focuses on 4 main aspects:</p>
    <p class="parawidth"><b>The place of purchase:</b>Can I buy this piece used? Can I rent the piece if I only need it for an event?</p>
    <p class="parawidth"><b>The reason for purchase/the lifespan of clothing: </b>Will I wear this piece regularly? Do I plan to wear this piece in the long term?</p>
    <p class="parawidth"><b>The production of clothing: </b>Were the workers treated fairly and paid a living wage? Does the production process use resources efficiently, avoid hazardous chemicals, and mistreatment of animals?</p>
    <p class="parawidth"><b>The actual clothing: </b>Is the material high-quality and made to last? Are the materials environmentally-friendly and biodegradable (able to break down naturally, like cotton)? Do they use animal products in the clothing, like leather or fur?</p>
    <p class="parawidth">Sustainability is the new buzzword for the fashion industry but some of the things we hear or read about sustainable fashion are not always correct, so let's bust some of these myths in this blog, and make sure we know what the whole thing is about. Let's check some of popular arguments that create myths about sustainable fashion’s sustainability…</p>
    <h4 class="parawidth mt-5" style="margin-left: 6.7em;">1. Expensive</h4>
    <p class="parawidth">This myth right here is probably one of the most believed myths about sustainable fashion. Sustainable fashion is expensive, not as cheap as 100% polyurethane sneakers from a mainstream brand, but it is still at an affordable level with wonderful quality. Considering how a sustainable brand provides fair working conditions to employees, it is also worth the investment. Responsible fashion urges us to spend our money on things we believe in. However, we interpret that wherever our privilege lies, it’s an investment in ourselves, our societies, and our planet.</p>
    <h4 class="parawidth mt-5" style="margin-left: 6.7em;">2. Boring and Dull</h4>
    <p class="parawidth">If you hold the belief that sustainable and ethical fashion just isn’t cool, think again. It’s a lazy and uninformed opinion to immediately write off the remarkable brands working hard to transform the fashion industry, one well-crafted, humanely made and environmentally friendly garment at a time. There are many brands out there, both big and small, ranging from more affordable to luxury, which are producing clothes that are trend-led, beautifully made and flattering.</p>
    <h4 class="parawidth mt-5" style="margin-left: 6.7em;">3.	Recycling of clothes makes you sustainable consumer</h4>
    <p class="parawidth">Bringing your clothes to a recycling bin is the best thing you can do! That way they can be re-used or recycled. Of course to be a sustainable consumer you want to do more. As consumers we need more information on how to sort our old garments because now people throw torn garments in the waste bin, instead of the garment bin, but even dirty or torn garments can be recycled. <br> Nowadays there are too many garments burned which could be new materials for our mechanically or chemically recycled collections. Technically we have all opportunities. We have to create the right infrastructure together with the government, the industry, the waste handlers and the consumer.</p>
    <h4 class="parawidth mt-5" style="margin-left: 6.7em;">How Bethany Williams is dealing to bust these myths on sustainable </h4>
    <p class="parawidth"><b>Fashion:</b></p>
    <p class="parawidth">“We have to tackle many challenges as far as Sustainability is concerned, one of the biggest one is the misconception about ethical fashion: it doesn't look cool, glamorous, nor stylish, we want to change that and make it fun, fresh, modern and desirable”! – Bethany Williams, the founder of Bethany Williams Fashion <br>
        Sustainable fashion deserves a chance All these myths block the way to green shopping. Yet, sustainable fashion is all about the environment and ethics. <br>
        Contrary to popular belief, it is affordable and fashionable. Available online and offline, it is just waiting for a chance.
