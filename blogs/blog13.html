The garments and accessories that man or ladies wear, assist them with relating to a gathering of others-whether it is a way of life, profession, a religion, or an attitude. Hence, the term 'fashion' has gotten inseparable from the general development of the nation also. <br><br>
            Today, fashion doesn't really mean style, or the urge to follow the latest things.

        <p class="parawidth">Sustainability is important because all the choices we pursue and all the actions that we make today will affect everything in the future. We need to make sound decisions at present in order to avoid limiting the choices of generations to come. The reasons for environmental destruction are mainly due to population levels, consumption, technology and the economic system. The issue in thinking about the global environment has less to do with population growth than it does with levels of consumption by those living.</p>
