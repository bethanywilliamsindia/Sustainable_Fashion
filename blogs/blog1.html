        <div class="d-flex justify-content-end parawidth mt-4">

        </div>
        <div class="parawidth mb-3"><small>1st January 2021</small></div>
        <p class="parawidth">Bethany Williams is thrilled to announce a fabric donation drive for our new clothing line. We as a sustainable fashion label were welcomed in the Indian market in 2021 and we are all set to function in the country. Starting with e-commerce as our mode of packaging and distribution we have also set up our physical stores across the country and we would warmly welcome our customers in pay a visit. </p>
        <p class="parawidth">On that note Bethany Williams would like to announce that the label will be designing clothes with the fabric obtained from the pre-loved, pre-owned, old clothes from our customers. The brand wants to bring up a remarkable change before launching the new collection and hence we would love our customers to donate their clothes to the label; after post-processing and safety measures are taken we will be designing and producing an entire collection out of the same clothes. The customers will be eligible to avail a discount on all the products under the label across the country, each time you donate clothes to our label. </p>
        <p class="parawidth">One of the prominent reasons for this drive is considering the current environmental damage done because of fast fashion done by fast fashion tycoons. This practice will break the chain and bring about a small change in getting away from dumping textile waste into the environment resulting in pollution. </p>
        <p class="parawidth">Globally, one garbage truck containing textile waste is dumped at a Landfill or burnt every second leading to massive amount of pollution which is more than hazardous to the environment. Bethany Williams as a sustainable fashion brand focus on clothing quality and long-lasting materials in their clothing production. Since the launch, the label has been collaborating with local small businesses for their fabrics, packaging distribution, purposes .The brand is also helping by collaborating with local artists encouraging supporting and bringing back textile crafts of India like block printing, Madhubani, Dabu, Indigo, Kalamkari, ikta, etc.</p>
        <p class="parawidth"> For a country like India where fast fashion is prevalent, a brand like Bethany Williams is lighting a fire for the change.
            Follow the simple steps for donating the clothes and availing of the discount. <br>
            <b>Step 1:</b> walk into the nearest Bethany William Store and our staff will assist you with the donation process. <br>
            <b>Step 2:</b> don't forget to claim your discount coupon once you have donated the clothes. (15% on 2kg cloths) <br>
            <b>Step 3:</b> use our discount coupon for online or offline shopping of any Bethany William product Pan India. <br>
        </p>
        <p class="parawidth">Considering the pandemic one can also book a slot for collection of of the clothes from their doorstep on the Bethany Williams India app.</p>
