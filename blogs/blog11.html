            Men are dressing more expressively than ever, bringing their personal sensibilities into work dressing! <br><br>
            India is an incredibly diverse and vibrant country that is continuously changing and growing as the years go by. From the Himalayan mountains to the Indian ocean’s coastline, the weather and the climate vary from region to region.<br><br>
            Clothing for men has traditionally been deeply compartmentalized, there’s a suit or dress shirt and trousers for regular workdays, polo T-shirts and khakis for Fridays, traditional garments for festivities, and shorts for holidays and the gym. There are rules about colours, patterns and cuts, especially when it comes to work, from pinstripes and small checks to dull monotones of brown, blue or grey. So categorical are the regulations that a man’s wardrobe could be reduced to five colours and a dozen items to last forever. It might sound hyperbolic, but it isn’t far from the truth. Ever wondered why it takes the average guy just “5 minutes" to get dressed? Somewhere in this one-dimensional closet lies the answer.<br><br>
            Suddenly, men stopped looking like they lived out of a tiny wardrobe. They wore suits in myriad hues, added eye-catching accessories, and didn’t think twice about going sock-less. Menswear was simultaneously dapper and daring, and it was all the better for it. Today, men are not only a lot more conscious about maintaining a good physique and staying well groomed, but are also experimenting with new trends. Maximalism, athleticism, bold prints, logo mania, fresh colours and street styles are some of the leading trends that are plastered all over the runways, both Indian and international.<br><br>
            The demand for kurta pyjamas topped with button down waistcoats signals a blending of the traditional and contemporary. Ideas emanating from across the globe are captivating Indian audiences who want to signal their broad worldview by wearing garments that fuse the traditional with the most modern.  <br><br>
            When men buy apparel, they signal to labels if they have their finger on the pulse of the fashion industry. Importantly, Indian men today are aware that accessories help complete an outfit and are willing to pay premium prices for accessories that create a desirable appearance.<br><br>
            “Men’s fashion is on realms of dynamic evolution blurring the lines of safeguarded notion of masculinity. Gender fluidity, gender conformity and also the concept of personal individuality is gaining momentum globally and thus reflecting in the men’s wardrobes Indian men are doing away with stuffy formal suits and replacing them with sleek ones having sharp lines. The evolution of Indian men also clearly indicates a preference for quality over quantity.” says Queen Elizabeth Awardee designer Bethany Williams.<br><br>
            She further added “Indian men are eagerly emulating his fashion sense by buying over the top garments. Demand for sherwanis like those worn by him is growing as is demand for resplendent shirts. However, some catwalk trends are borderline crazy, many are adaptable for day-to-day styling. today’s urban Indian male doesn’t fear judgement”<br><br>
            Menswear in India has been in a ‘safe zone’ for a long time. But, in recent years, we have seen a huge shift because of the rise of fashion influencers on social media and the need to stand out. Indian men are eagerly emulating his fashion sense by buying over the top garments. <br><br>
